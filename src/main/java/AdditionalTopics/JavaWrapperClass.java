/*
The wrapper classes in Java are used to convert
primitive types (int, char, float, etc) into
corresponding objects.

Each of the 8 primitive types has corresponding
wrapper classes.
primitive   Wrapper
type        Class

byte	    Byte
boolean	    Boolean
char	    Character
double	    Double
float	    Float
int	        Integer
long	    Long
short	    Short

Convert Primitive Type to Wrapper Objects
We can also use the valueOf() method to convert primitive
types into corresponding objects.

Advantages of Wrapper Classes
In Java, sometimes we might need to use objects instead
of primitive data types.
