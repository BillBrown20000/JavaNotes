/*
Working of PrintStream
Unlike other output streams, the PrintStream converts the primitive data
(integer, character)
into the text format instead of bytes.
It then writes that formatted data to the output stream.

print() Method

print() - prints the specified data to the output stream

println() - prints the data to the output stream along with a new
line character at the end

close()	closes the print stream

checkError()	checks if there is an error in the stream and
returns a boolean result

append()	appends the specified data to the stream
