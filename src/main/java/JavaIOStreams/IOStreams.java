/*
In Java, streams are the sequence of data that are read
from the source and written to the destination.

An input stream is used to read data from the source.
And, an output stream is used to write data to the destination.

Types of Streams
Byte Stream
Byte stream is used to read and write a single byte (8 bits) of data.
All byte stream classes are derived from base abstract
classes called InputStream and OutputStream.

Character Stream
Character stream is used to read and write a single character of data.
All the character stream classes are derived from base abstract
classes Reader and Writer.
