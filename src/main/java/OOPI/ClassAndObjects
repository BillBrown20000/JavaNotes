Java is an object-oriented programming language.
It is based on the concept of objects.
These objects share two characteristics:
state (fields)
behavior (methods)
You can think of a class as a blueprint for the object

for example
class Lamp {

  // instance variable
  private boolean isOn;

  // method
  public void turnOn() {
    isOn = true;
  }

  // method
  public void turnOff() {
  	isOn = false;
  }
}
