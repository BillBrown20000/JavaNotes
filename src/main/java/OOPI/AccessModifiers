Whats an access modifier?
In Java, access modifiers are used to set the accessibility
(visibility) of classes,
interfaces, variables, methods, constructors, data members,
and the setter methods.

There are four access modifiers keywords in Java and they are:
Default
Private
Protected
Public

Default Am
If we do not explicitly specify any access modifier for
classes, methods, variables, etc,
then by default the default access modifier is considered.

Private Am
When variables and methods are declared private,
they cannot be accessed outside of the class.
What if we need to access those private variables.
we can use the getters and setters method

Protected Am
When methods and data members are declared protected,
we can access them within the same package as well as from subclasses.

Public
When methods, variables, classes, and so on are declared public,
then we can access them from anywhere.
The public access modifier has no scope restriction.
