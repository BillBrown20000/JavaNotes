What is a constructor
In Java, every class has its constructor that is
invoked automatically when an object of the class is created.
A constructor is similar to a method but in actual, it is not a method.

In Java, constructors can be divided into 3 types:

No-Arg Constructor
A Java constructor may or may not have any parameters (arguments).
If a constructor does not accept any parameters,
it is known as a no-arg constructor. For example,

Default Constructor
If you do not create any constructors, the Java compiler
will automatically create a no-argument constructor during run-time.
This constructor is known as the default constructor. The default
constructor initializes any uninitialized instance variables with
default values.

Parameterized Constructor
Similar to methods, we can pass parameters to a constructor.
 Such constructors are known as a parameterized constructor.
