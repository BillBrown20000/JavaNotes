+	Addition (also used for string concatenation)
-	Subtraction Operator
*	Multiplication Operator
/	Division Operator
%	Remainder Operator

+	Unary plus (not necessary to use since numbers are positive without using it)
-	Unary minus: inverts the sign of an expression
++	Increment operator: increments value by 1
--	decrement operator: decrements value by 1
!	Logical complement operator: inverts the value of a boolean

==	equal to	5 == 3 is evaluated to false
!=	not equal to	5 != 3 is evaluated to true
>	greater than	5 > 3 is evaluated to true
<	less than	5 < 3 is evaluated to false
>=	greater than or equal to	5 >= 5 is evaluated to true
<=	less than or equal to	5 <= 5 is evaluated to true

||	conditional-OR: true if either of the boolean expression is true	false || true is evaluated to true
&&	conditional-AND: true if all boolean expressions are true	false && true is evaluated to false

~	Bitwise Complement
<<	Left Shift
>>	Right Shift
>>>	Unsigned Right Shift
&	Bitwise AND
